Eager Loading

For example
This can be achieved, using the Include method

We have a student table and a StudentDetails table (related entity to student table),
Here, we are loading the student with the Id equal to studentId along with the student details. 


Student std = dbContext.Student.Include(a => a.StudentDetails).FirstOrDefault(a => a.studentId == studentId);   


Lazy Loading


For example, when we run the query given below, StudentDetails table will not be loaded along with the Student table. 

student std = dbContext.students.FirstOrDefault(a => a.studentId == studentId);  


It will only be loaded when you explicitly call for it


studentDeatils sd = std.studentDetails; // studentDetails are loaded here
